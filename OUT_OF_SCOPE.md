# Out of scope assets

This file includes the out-of-scope assets/features of Bug Bounty 1.0, specifying elements and items not covered by the program. It ensures transparency and sets clear boundaries for participants, helping them understand the scope limitations

\***\*Excluded:\*\***

- 3rd party issues (e.g., Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, CometBFT).
- The code that's added only for testing purposes (i.e. example smart contracts)
- We appreciate the inclusion of logging and additional unit tests in pull requests (PRs), but it's essential to note that issues related to these aspects are not considered as valid "bugs" within the scope of this program.
